# Smart-Irrigation-System

In India, agriculture is the need of most of the Indians livelihood and it is one of the main sources of livelihood. Agriculture also has a major impact on economy of the country. 
The increasing consumption of water day by day may lead to the problem of water scarcity. Farmers with a great water supply but lack of  knowledge tend to waste a lot of water as they merely know about how much water is to be supplied. 
Knowing when and how much to water is two important aspects of irrigation. To do this automatically, sensors and methods are available to determine when plants may need water. Automation involves mechanism of all the industrial activities so as to improve the speed of production, reduction of cost, effective use of resources.

In this project, water pump for irrigation of Land turn automatically on and off by sensing the moisture of soil, we are using soil moisture sensor for sensing moisture of soil and then turning water pump on and off in dry and moist soil respectively. This stm32 based project will be a budget friendly simple mechanism to help save as much water as possible.
